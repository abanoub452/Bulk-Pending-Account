Smoke Testing for Bulk Pending Customer Accounts
This project is a Selenium Java automation framework designed to perform smoke testing on the Bulk Pending Customer Accounts functionality. It utilizes JUnit for test execution and Cucumber for writing behavior-driven test scenarios in a human-readable format.

Key Features:
Automated Smoke Tests: Verifies the critical functionalities of the bulk account processing module to ensure stability after builds or changes.
Selenium WebDriver: Facilitates browser automation to interact with the application's UI components.
JUnit Integration: Provides test execution and reporting capabilities.
Cucumber Framework: Allows test cases to be written in Gherkin syntax, enhancing readability and collaboration.
Page Object Model (POM): Ensures maintainable and reusable code by encapsulating web elements and their interactions.
Use Case:
The automation suite simulates user workflows to process and validate bulk pending customer accounts, ensuring:

Successful upload and submission of bulk customer data.
Proper validation and error handling for incorrect or incomplete entries.
Accurate status updates for processed accounts.
How It Works:
Gherkin Scenarios: Test cases are written as feature files using Gherkin syntax.
Step Definitions: Maps Gherkin steps to Java methods, implemented using Selenium WebDriver.
Test Execution: JUnit runs the test suite, executing defined scenarios and generating detailed test reports.
Prerequisites:
Java (version X or higher)
JUnit (version Y or higher)
Cucumber (version Z or higher)
Selenium WebDriver
Dependencies managed with Maven/Gradle
